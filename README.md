# Dyalog-APL-Competition-2021
https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm

## Overview
The competition consists of two parts:

- **Phase 1** asks you to solve 10 puzzles by writing short APL functions, allowing you to demonstrate array-oriented thinking. You can begin without registering â€” your solutions should be stored by your browser until you decide to register and submit them (not all browsers do this).
- **Phase 2** comprises a collection of more difficult problems, each having one or two tasks. In addition to requiring array-oriented thinking, this enables you to show off your ability to write larger amounts of well-documented, high-quality, code.
